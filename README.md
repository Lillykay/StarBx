StarBx Clone Website
This is a README file for the StarBx Clone Website, a project developed by me. In this document, you will find information about the project, its purpose, features, and how it was created.

Project Overview
The StarBx Clone Website is a web application that aims to recreate the user experience of the popular coffee chain, Starbucks. The website offers a range of features and functionalities that mimic the original Starbucks website, allowing users to explore the menu, place orders, and customize their beverages just like they would in a real Starbucks store.

Motivation
The motivation behind creating the Starbucks Clone Website was a deep passion for web development and a love for the Starbucks brand. As an aspiring web developer, I wanted to challenge myself by creating a fully functional website that not only demonstrated my technical skills but also reflected my enthusiasm for a brand that I enjoy.

Features
The StarBx Clone Website includes several key features:

Menu Display: Users can browse through a comprehensive menu that showcases various coffee and tea options, along with detailed descriptions and prices.

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to the website to place orders and access additional features.

Customization Options: Users can personalize their beverage orders by selecting preferred size, milk type, sweeteners, and additional toppings.

Order Placement: Once logged in, users can add items to their cart, review their selections, and complete the ordering process.

Order History: Registered users can view their order history and track the status of their current orders.

Technologies Used
The StarBX Clone Website was developed using the following technologies:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a responsive front-end framework for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Back-end: A server-side scripting language (Js, Node.js) to handle the logic and functionality of the website.
Database: A database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user information, menu items, and order data.
